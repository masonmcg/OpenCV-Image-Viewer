Your task for this lab is to install the opencv library on your Linux computing environment, then write a C/C++ image viewer. Your program should run from the command line, taking the filename of an image as a command line argument, and should display that image to the user. You should build your C/C++ program using a makefile and the gcc (or g++) compiler.
